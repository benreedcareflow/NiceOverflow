NiceOverflow
============

A Stack Overflow client demonstrating a "nice" way of arranging your web services. The accompanying blog post is [here](http://commandshift.co.uk/blog/2014/01/02/nice-web-services/).

Note that the app uses the Stack Exchange API anonymously, and is therefore submitted to request rate limits as defined [here](https://api.stackexchange.com/docs/throttle). Be gentle.
